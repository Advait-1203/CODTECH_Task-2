## **Overview of the Project**
## Project : Crop Recommendation (Task-02)
## Objective
Agriculture remains a cornerstone of the global economy, providing sustenance and employment to billions. However, farmers often grapple with selecting the appropriate crops that align with their land's soil and climatic conditions. Misalignment can lead to reduced yields, economic losses, and environmental degradation. Crop Recommendation Systems leverage data analytics and machine learning to bridge this gap, offering personalized crop suggestions that maximize productivity and sustainability.\
In this Task, the model evalutaion and comparison was completed and various operations were done. This includes Analysis of Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium along with the comparison of NPK values and ratio and comparison of Various factors like Humidity, rainfall and temperature.

## Features / Key Activities
- The code provides a comprehensive nutrient analysis by highlighting Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) requirements for different crops.\
- It helps in identifying nutrient-intensive and low-demand crops through comparative visualizations.\
- Interactive bar charts display the top 10 and bottom 10 crops for each nutrient, with text annotations and hover interactions for better understanding.\
- Randomized colors are used to enhance the visual appeal, while interactive components engage users and make the charts more informative.\
- Data is sorted based on nutrient values to identify crops with the highest and lowest requirements.\
- Subplots are generated for side-by-side comparisons of nutrient demands across crops.\
- These visualizations provide targeted insights for optimizing nutrient application in farming, helping in the effective management of crop nutrition.\

## Technology Used
- Python Programming Language
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Crop Recommendeation.csv Dataset

## Conclusion
Important insights into the unique nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) requirements of various crops have been gained through the process of data review and comparison utilising nutrient analysis. The technique successfully identifies low-demand and nutrient-intensive crops by utilising interactive visualisations like pie charts and bar charts, enabling tailored recommendations. A clear comparison of crop nutrient demands was made possible by sorting the data according to nutrient values, which highlighted the crops that required the most and the least amount of nutrients. In order to maximise nutrient application in farming and, eventually, assist farmers in better managing crop nutrition, this procedure is essential. These visualisations facilitate the effective decision-making process for agricultural practices by providing important insights into nutrient management in an understandable and educational way.
