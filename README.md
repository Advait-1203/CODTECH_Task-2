## **Overview of the Project**
## Project : Crop Recommendation (Task-02)
## Objective
Agriculture remains a cornerstone of the global economy, providing sustenance and employment to billions. However, farmers often grapple with selecting the appropriate crops that align with their land's soil and climatic conditions. Misalignment can lead to reduced yields, economic losses, and environmental degradation. Crop Recommendation Systems leverage data analytics and machine learning to bridge this gap, offering personalized crop suggestions that maximize productivity and sustainability.\
In this Task, the model evalutaion and comparison was completed and various operations were done. This includes Analysis of Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium along with the comparison of NPK values and ratio and comparison of Various factors like Humidity, rainfall and temperature.

## Features / Key Activities
- **Soil-Based Recommendations**: AI analyzes soil properties like pH, nutrient levels, and texture, suggesting crops best suited for specific soil conditions.\
- **Weather and Climate Integration**: The system considers temperature, rainfall, and seasonal patterns to offer location-specific crop recommendations for optimal growth.\
- **Market and Economic Insights**: By predicting profitability based on market demand and pricing trends, it helps farmers choose crops with higher revenue potential.\
- **Pest and Disease Risk Assessment**: Using historical data and AI models, the system identifies potential risks, providing early warnings and preventive measures to protect crops.\
- **Sustainability and Resource Efficiency**: It recommends crops requiring less water and fertilizers, promoting eco-friendly farming and long-term soil health.\
